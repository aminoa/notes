        I originally treated like another non-fiction piece but I realized that
        Tara’s memoir is narratively-driven (both in terms of characters and
        events) so I’ll view it through that lens. Furthermore, this won’t be a
        summary, but a thought dump. I’ve seen glances of the cover a couple of
        times but I saw it once on display in a public library and decided to
        take a small read through. To be honest, it didn’t leave a strong
        impression but I put it on my Goodreads and picked up it up a two months
        back. I found Buck’s Peak, Idaho to be vividly described, the mountain
        always in view of the home, the junkyard beside the house, the crimson
        furniture (I think couch), the stokes supermarket a drive away. The
        memoir also describes the characters of the memoir well, learning about
        the survivalist views of Tara’s father and later on, the belief in
        alternative medicine from her mother. Tara writes her memoir with a slow
        pacing and a large amount of exposition at the beginning to set up what
        her life and family, making the transition to her move to Cambridge all
        the more jarring. With that being said, the memoir spent too much time
        in this initial setting and Tara’s final leave to BYU/Oxford took too
        long. I’m aware that this is a memoir so Tara doesn’t have the luxury of
        being able to shift around events but it still negatively affected the
        pacing and I started to lose interest about midway through the book,
        until she left to university. I do feel better about the character
        interactions. Her conflicts with Shawn were particularly tense; every
        time he appeared, it felt like there was a ticking time bomb. The battle
        between the siblings settles in an unamicable way, with most of the
        family choosing to take Shawn’s side over Tara’s when she finally
        reveals how he’s treated her.
